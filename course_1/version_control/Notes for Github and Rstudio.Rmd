  Here I give a brief introduction about how to use version control in Rstudio.
  

1. Register a github account at https://github.com/. For example, my account is _johnsonzhj_ and my email is johnsonzhj@gmail.com. You can skip this step if you already have an account available.

2. In **Rstudio**, click Tools-->Global Options-->Git/SVN-->**Create RSA key**-->Create. Then in Options interface of Git/SVN, click **View public key**, copy the **whole** content accordingly (with Ctrl+C as a shortcut). Then in an internet browser(eg. Chrome), login in your github account. In **dropdown menu**, click settings-->SSH keys-->add SSH key and paste the key you copied previously to **key** dialogue box, add a name you prefer to title dialogue box click add key.


3. Download software **git** (not github) from <https://git-scm.com/> and install it accordingly once available.

4. Back to Rstudio, In menu tools-->Global option-->Git/SVN: Git executable dialogue box, change the direcotry to C:\\program and files\\git\\bin\\git\.exe. (this is for Windows only. In Mac, the default **/usr/bin/git** is already fine). 


5. In github, you should set up a new repository under menu **repositories**. For example, a new repository called _rdata_. Now you'll get a new url like this: <https://github.com/your_account_name/rdata>.

6. In Rstudio, click Tool-->shell and type following script with your own email and user name.

```
       git config --global user.email "your email address"
       git config --global user.name "your user name"
       git config --list
       git push -u origin master
```

7. In Rstudio, click file-->new project-->version control-->git copy the new generated url in step 5 to "Repository url" together with a suffix .git (you can also choose to click **dropdown** of **Clone or download** option in the github repository, choose **use HTTPS** and copy the link directly) and create a name for the folder and the local directory accordingly.


8. Now you should be able to see a **Git** tab at the middle top of the Rstudio interface. Try to Click "commit" in Git (you can add commit information) and then click Push Branch the file. Then it **succeed**!

9. I will demonstrate how to use the **commit**,**pull** and **push** in Rstudio during the course.
